### Technology
 - OpenGL v4 by default, v3 for a compatibility
### Performance
 - Fast drawing up to 20+M triangles,
 - Hardware-accelerated object picker (finding triangle or point under the cursor).
### Viewport camera modes
 - Perspective and Orthographic,
 - Renderable objects
   - Cloud points,
   - Meshes,
   - Lines,
   - Voxels
   - DistanceMaps
### Color and textures 
 - Vertices color map,
 - Triangles color map,
 - Static textures.
### Order independed transparency

Perfect and fast visualization of many transparent objects with complex geometry using OpenGL 4:

### Convenient for mesh algorithms debugging, showing mesh edges, boundaries
### Computed-tomography reconstruction
An ability to reconstruct voxel object from a set of projection images (radiographs) and known cone-beam CT scanner geometry parameters. Nvidia GPU is utilized via CUDA technology for the best reconstruction performance.
